Developer manual
================

This chapter is addressed to the developer who wants to contribute to PLASMA Lab or use it in their own project.
First, we present an overview of the architecture, describing the basic concepts inside PLASMA Lab.
Each main components/concepts of the platform is detailed in a separate section.
Finally, we propose a short tutorial that describes how to implement new features in the tool.

The Javadoc of PLASMA Lab's API can be found `here <http://plasma-lab.gforge.inria.fr/plasma_lab_api/>`__ (select your version).
