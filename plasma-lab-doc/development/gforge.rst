PLASMA Lab @ INRIA
==================

The PLASMA Lab project is developed and hosted by INRIA. In this
section we describe the various support tools provided by INRIA.

GForge
------

PLASMA Lab is hosted on the `INRIA
Forge <https://gforge.inria.fr/projects/plasma-lab/>`__. The forge
provides a git repository, an HTTP server and access to bug tracking
tools and mailing list.

To access these services an INRIA Forge account is required. The INRIA Forge does not use the LDAP account.

Git
^^^

Git is our Version Control System. The Git documentation can be accessed on:

- `<http://git-scm.com/book/fr>`__

Only developers registered on the forge can access to the Git
repository. SSH must be installed on your computer.

Tracking tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- `Bugs and issues tracking tool <https://gforge.inria.fr/tracker/?atid=13820&group_id=4484&func=browse>`__
- `Technical solutions tracking tool <https://gforge.inria.fr/tracker/?atid=13902&group_id=4484&func=browse>`__

Support
^^^^^^^

- `PLASMA Lab support mailing list <mailot:plasma-lab-support@NOSPAM@lists.gforge.inria.fr>`__

GForge hosting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The INRIA GForge provides hosting capacity. The PLASMA Lab GForge
website is located at http://plasma-lab.gforge.inria.fr/. We use this to
host the Javadoc and this manual but also as a repository for PLASMA Lab bundles and examples library.

Web site
--------

The main PLASMA Lab website is hosted on `<https://project.inria.fr/plasma-lab/>`__.
It is a wordpress blog/site and can be modified by accessing to the `administration interface <https://project.inria.fr/plasma-lab/wp-admin>`__.

project.inria.fr depends from a different service than GForge.
