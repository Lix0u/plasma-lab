To run PLASMA Lab on IGRIDA you must copy some scripts and a PLASMA Lab version on the frontend.


CONFIGURATION

To run properly, the plasma lab directory should be as:
- fr.inria.plasmalab.plasmalab-VERSION.jar
- plasmalab.conf
- perso_log4j.xml
- plugins
- * PLUGIN NEEDED FOR THE EXPERIMENTi

Alternatively you can specify plugin location using the plasmalab.conf file. As you would on your own PLASMA Lab installation directory.

USAGE

To launch a PLASMA Lab experiment using IGRIDA you need to be connected to the oarfrontend USER@igrida-oar-frontend. Here you can launch a script, like the plasma_script.sh example.
This script will then submit a job to the OAR scheduler using the command oarsub. The job is described in the file plasma_script.job. 

To test your installation, launch an interactive session using:
- oarsub -I

Once you are in the interactive session you can launch PLASMA directly using 
- java -jar fr.inria.plasmalab.plasmalab-VERSION.jar
